# Stock-Market-Analysis

Stock  market prediction is a challenging task, which actually  contains a lot of person-system connect. So, traditional data processing techniques are inefficient for stock analysis.
Stock market prices depends up on the nature of the market. So, it is difficult to predict the cost. Earlier most of the Researchers  have used Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)  to predict the stock prices but  it can predict for short term  only.

In order to predict the long  term share price accurately we are using Extension of Recurrent Neural Network  i.e  Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) and GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit) in our proposed algorithm. LSTM and GRU solves the 'vanishing gradient' problem that exists in RNN by learning long term dependencies with use of memory cell (states) and (input and output) gates.

Some of the existing Algorithms were analyzed like RNN, LSTM and GRU based on some of the factors like Performance, memory Execution Time. 

Based on the calculations that were performed on the algorithms the best algorithm was selected and the process of testing was carried out using that algorithm. The findings of a comparison of GRU and LSTM prediction accuracy demonstrate that GRU outperforms LSTM, because GRU uses less memory and is faster than LSTM .

GRU address vanishing Gradient Problem from which Recurrent neural network suffer .GRU  solve this problem using Reset gate.
